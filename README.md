## Setting Up and Running the React Native Project (Location Search with Auto-Filter)

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Before cloning and running the project, make sure you have the following installed:.
            Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
            React Native CLI
            Git (for cloning the repository)
            Xcode (for iOS, if running on Mac)
            Android Studio (for Android)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies

  This command will install all the packages listed in package.json, such as libraries for maps, location services, and UI components.

```bash
# using npm
npm install

```

### Step 2: Configure Environment (API Keys)
 you need to configure your API key. You can add the API keys in a .env file or directly in your code.

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm

npm run ios

```

### Step 3: Testing Location Search with Auto-Filter
Once the app is running, test the location search functionality by typing into the search bar. The auto-filtering should work in real-time, displaying relevant location suggestions based on user input.
